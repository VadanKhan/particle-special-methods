## Build & run Instructions

### Prerequisites

You will need a C++ compiler that supports C++17. The code has been tested with GCC 11.

### Compiling

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the program using the following command:

**For Windows** This command will produce the following file in the same directory you're running on:

`g++ assignment-4.cpp -o assignment-4.exe -std=gnu++17`

Which you can then execute in a terminal using:

`./assignment-4.exe`


**For Mac** This command will produce the following file in the same directory you're running on:

`g++ assignment-4.cpp -o assignment-4.o -std=gnu++17`

Which you can then execute in a terminal using:

`./assignment-4.o`

Note: One can also use make files to automate this compilation.
**For Windows**: you can install MinGW's makefile.exe and then use 'nmake' command when in root directory
Note this will expect the Makefile to be in root directory with name "Makefile"
**For Mac**: Can just run `make`.
Note this will expect the Makefile to be in root directory with name "Makefile"
